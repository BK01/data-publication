# HOW TO ASSOCIATE DATA TO BC'S OPEN DATA LICENCE
It is recommended to publish data under an Open Government Licence, where possible, as it is much more permissive. Some tools require this licence to be applied, like Shiny.

This document is intended for BC Government employees to follow to apply our open data licence to datasets that are under their authority.

Broader Public Sector (BPS) agencies are required to [create their own licence](open_data_licence_create.md) but are welcome to publish data in the BC Data Catalogue (BCDC).
* Refer to the [BCDC documentation](dps_bcdc.md)

## REVIEW THE OPEN DATA POLICY
Before starting the process review the [Open Information and Open Data Policy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/information-management-technology/information-privacy/resources/policies-guidelines/open-information-open-data-policy.pdf).

## REVIEW THE OPEN GOVERNMENT LICENCE - BRITISH COLUMBIA
Review the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia (OGL-BC)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61) to ensure the licence is correct for the needs of the business and data. 

## ENSURE THE DATA IS IN AN OPEN FORMAT
Data can be released in multiple formats but at least one must be in an __open format__, e.g., 
- CSV, 
- Shape File (SHP), 
- JSON,
- GeoPackage,
- or additional formats noted by the OCIO’s [Open Data Physical Dataset Format Standard](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/open_data_physical_dataset_extract.pdf). 

For guidelines on [open format file content](dsg_bcdc_file_based_content.md) formating.

## BC DATA CATALOGUE METADATA RECORDS
All datasets under the OGL-BC require a metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue (BCDC), aka, the Catalogue.

Irregardless if a dataset is under the OGL, any BC Governement or Broader Public Sector (BPS) dataset can be published in the BCDC.

To obtain an __account__ and publish metadata records follow the [BCDC documentation](dps_bcdc.md) and the [Publication Workflow](dps_bcdc_w.md).

## COMPLETE AND SUBMIT THE OPEN DATA ASSESSMENT AND CHECKLIST
The [Open Data Assessment and Checklist](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) must be completed and the appropriate people contacted.

The checklist ensures the following:
1. There the data contains __no personal information__.
1. That the __province has the intelectual property__ of the data
