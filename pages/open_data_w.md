It is recommended to publish data under an Open Government Licence, where possible, as it is much more permissive. Some tools require this license to be applied, like Shiny.

To publish a dataset under [Open Government Licence - British Columbia (OGL-BC)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/open-data/open-government-licence-bc) the following needs to be completed: 
1. Completed [Open Data Assessment and Checklist](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx). These include:
	1. Confrimation from [The Ministry Information Security Officer (MISO)](https://intranet.gov.bc.ca/intranet/content?id=DC4623F6F1944065B83F70297ED419D7)
	1. Confirmation from [The Intellectual Properties Office (email)](mailto:QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca) that the province has the intelectual properties of the data.
	1. A signature from the Custodial organization’s Deputy Minister or designated alternate.
1. it is in an open format, e.g., CSV, Shape File (SHP), JSON, or additional formats noted by the OCIO’s [Open Data Physical Dataset Format Standard](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/open_data_physical_dataset_extract.pdf). 
1. A metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue is published and the record links to the appropriate Open Data Licence.

Once these approvals are in place, and the completed Open Data Assessment and Checkist and signature, the data can be published under OGL-BC
