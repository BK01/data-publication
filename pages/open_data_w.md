# HOW TO OBTAIN AN OPEN DATA LICENCE
It is recommended to publish data under an Open Government Licence, where possible, as it is much more permissive. Some tools require this licence to be applied, like Shiny.

## Review the Open Data Policy
Before starting the process review the [Open Information and Open Data Policy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/information-management-technology/information-privacy/resources/policies-guidelines/open-information-open-data-policy.pdf).

## Review the Open Government Licence - British Columbia (OGL-BC) 
Review the [OGL-BC](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61) to ensure the licence is correct for the needs of the businss and data. 

## Ensure the Data is an Open Format
Data can be released in multiple formats but at least one must be in an __open format__, e.g., 
- CSV, 
- Shape File (SHP), 
- JSON,
- GeoPackage,
- or additional formats noted by the OCIO’s [Open Data Physical Dataset Format Standard](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/open_data_physical_dataset_extract.pdf). 

Guidelines for [open format file content](dsg_bcdc_file_based_content.md).

## BC Data Catalogue Metadata Records
All datasets under the OGL-BC require a metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue (BCDC), aka, the Catalouge.

Irregardless if a dataset is under the OGL, any BC Governement or Broader Public Sector (BPS) dataset can be published in the Catalogue.

To obtain an __account__ and publish metadata records follow the [Catalogue documation](dps_bcdc.md) and the [__BCDC Publication Workflow__](dps_bcdc_w.md).

## Complete the Open Data Assessment and Checklist
The [__Open Data Assessment and Checklist__](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) needs to be completed and the appropriate people contacted and then this is sent back to [data@gov.bc.ca](mailto:data@gov.bc.ca) or the DataBC Program Services Team you are working with in regards to publishing data.

1. There the data contains __no personal information__.
1. That the __province has the intelectual property__ of the data
 + This is to be __confirmed by__ contacting the [Intellectual Properties Office (QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca)](mailto:QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca).
1. That the data is __not under any legal, contractual or policy contraint__.
1. That the data is __publicly releasable__

1. That the data is __not currently for sale__.


## Signatures
Signatures are required from the following and can be submitted to the DataBC Program in the form of a scanned signature in the [__Open Data Assessment and Checklist__](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) or an e-approval process the ministry has in place:
1. The Data Custodian
1. The Custodial organization’s Deputy Minister or designated alternate.


## Final Publication
1. We recommend working with your Government Communication Officer around the release of a dataset under the OGL-BC.
1. A member of the DataBC Program will assist the publication of the metadata record and provide any feedback necessary.
